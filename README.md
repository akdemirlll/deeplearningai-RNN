## deeplearning.ai Sequence Models Week 1
This repository contains deeplearning.ai's Sequence Model course Week 1 notebooks.

### Contents:
- Step-by-step: Build an RNN
- Character level language modeling
- Music Synthesis with LSTM (using Keras)

### Usage:
- Download or clone repository: 
`git clone https://github.com/sukruc/deeplearningai-RNN.git`
- Keep directory structure as is to make sure notebooks function normally
- Enjoy!

### Notes:
- Backward propagation part in Step-by-step RNN implementation contains some bugs and inconsistent notation regarding equations. You can either skip this part or cross-check with external sources to make sure they are working properly.
- Wiki will be updated to include correct backpropagation equations, implementation and further discussion.
- Ignore commented `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` lines, if you ever encounter them. They are not included in original notebooks.
- Please feel free to make any suggestions.
