## deeplearning.ai Sequence Models Week 1
This repository contains deeplearning.ai's Sequence Model course Week 1 notebooks.

### Contents:
- Step-by-step: Build an RNN
- Character level language modeling
- Music Synthesis with LSTM (using Keras)

### Usage:
- Download or clone repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/sukruc/deeplearningai-RNN.git`  
<del>- Keep directory structure as is to make sure notebooks function normally</del>   
- Datasets and images are not included, so you need to replace them if you want to make notebooks work.
- Enjoy!

### Notes:
- It is not guaranteed that solutions provided here are correct or optimal. Please only use notebooks as a reference.
- Backward propagation part in Step-by-step RNN implementation contains some bugs and inconsistent notation regarding equations. You can either skip this part or cross-check with external sources to make sure they are working properly.
- Wiki will be updated to include correct backpropagation equations, implementation and further discussion.
- Ignore commented `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` lines, if you ever encounter them. They are not included in original notebooks.
- Please feel free to make any suggestions.
